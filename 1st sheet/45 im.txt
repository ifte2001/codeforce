logic:
*** condition: we must swap their sign one time...
there will be 3 sitution 
sitution 1: two number will be like >>> -1 -1   ... if we swap their sign >>> 1  1
sitution 2: two number will be like >>> 1 1    ... if we swap their sign >>>  -1  -1
sitution 3: two number will be like >>> 1 -1  or -1 1   ... if we swap their sign >>>  -1 1  or 1  -1
for first sitution >>> we have to subtitude 4 with the total sum of the array...
for second sitution >>> we have to add 4 with the total sum of the array...
for third sitution >>> we need not do anything because if we swap their sign the change will be zero...

we have do that three things in loop 
becase we have to see which sum will be maximum according the question
