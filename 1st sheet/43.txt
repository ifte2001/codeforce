    For example, if a=1 and b=1 (he has one 1-burle coin and one 2 burle coin), then:

    n=1... he can pay 1 burle without change, paying with one 1 burle coin,
    n=2... he can pay 2 burle without change, paying with one 2 burle coin,
    n=3... he can pay 3 burle without change by paying with one 1-burle coin and one 2 burle coin,
    n=4... he cannot pay 4 burle without change (moreover, he cannot pay this amount at all). 

    so we have to find out the number of 'n'...
    so the logic is...
    the number of n will be (total money + 1)...
