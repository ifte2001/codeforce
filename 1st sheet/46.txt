logic:
if two adjacent elements are odd or even... then we will consider them as same pair...
otherwise they are different pair...
in this problem we have to make all adjacent elements different pair... by multiply the adjacent of same pair...
my logic is:
we have see how many adjacent elements are there which are same pair...
